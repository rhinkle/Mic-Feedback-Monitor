## Codebase Patterns
- Use `.venv/bin/mypy --ignore-missing-imports` for type checking
- Project uses Python 3.13 with venv at .venv/
- Main entry point is mic_monitor.py

- **What was implemented**: Project setup and dependencies
  - Created requirements.txt with rumps, sounddevice, numpy
  - Created main entry point mic_monitor.py
  - Created empty modules: audio_engine.py and settings.py
  - Added .gitignore for Python projects
- **Files changed**: requirements.txt, mic_monitor.py, audio_engine.py, settings.py, .gitignore, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This is a fresh project with no git repo, so needed to initialize git first
  - Using mypy with --ignore-missing-imports since third-party stubs aren't installed
  - Installed mypy in venv for type checking

- **What was implemented**: Settings manager module
  - Implemented SettingsManager class with full functionality
  - Settings stored at ~/Library/Application Support/MicMonitor/config.json
  - Default values: volume=50, latency_ms=20, monitoring_enabled=False
  - load() reads config or returns defaults if file missing (handles JSON errors gracefully)
  - save() writes current settings, creating directory if needed
  - Added property accessors with validation (volume 0-100, latency 5-100ms)
- **Files changed**: settings.py, prd.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SettingsManager exposes settings via properties with getters/setters for validation
  - Config directory is auto-created in save() using mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
  - load() and save() handle file I/O; properties manage in-memory state
